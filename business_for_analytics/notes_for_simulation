Lowering price was the biggest difference.  Lowere price to 6 and demand was 65 mil.  Lowered price to 5 dollars and no advertising and profit plummeted.  Kept price the same and included all demographics and profit soared.

Lowered to 4.75 and profit dropped.  

What I think I should try is lowering the price slowly.  Also lower the amount of advertising, not 0, but reduce it.

s1 -2019 
	- Still no traction in northeast.  Think about not selling there.
	- Production at 65 million still, think about doing 65.2 mill

s1 - 2020
	- Lost a lot in profitability because demand stayed around the same (only 68.8)
	- market share stayed consistent so should focuse on profitability


s1 -2021
	- keeps excess inventory so profitability still decreased because I have lots of leftover product


s2 2019
	- Demand was 83.7 at price point of $5
	- kept everything the same as s1.
