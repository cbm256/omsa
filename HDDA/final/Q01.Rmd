## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ridge}
library("glmnet")
library(tidyverse)
train = as_data_frame(read.csv("Q1_training_.csv", header=TRUE))
test = as_data_frame(read.csv("Q1_testing_.csv", header=TRUE))

x_multi = as.matrix(train[,4:length(train)])
y_multi = as.matrix(train[2])

new_x = as.matrix(test[,4:length(test)])

ridge2_cv <- cv.glmnet(x = x_multi, y = y_multi,
                       ## type.measure: loss to use for cross-validation.
                       type.measure = "deviance",
                       ## K = 10 is the default.
                       nfold = 10,
                       ## Multinomial regression
                       family = "multinomial",
                       ## ‘alpha = 1’ is the lasso penalty, and ‘alpha = 0’ the ridge penalty.
                       alpha = 0)
best_ridge_coef2 <- do.call(cbind, coef(ridge2_cv, s = ridge2_cv$lambda.min))
best_ridge_weights2 <- 1 / abs(as.matrix(best_ridge_coef2)[-1,])

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r adaptive_lasso, echo=FALSE}

alasso2_cv <- cv.glmnet(x = x_multi, y = y_multi,
                     ## type.measure: loss to use for cross-validation.
                     type.measure = "deviance",
                     ## K = 10 is the default.
                     nfold = 10,
                     ## Multinomial regression
                     family = "multinomial",
                     ## ‘alpha = 1’ is the lasso penalty, and ‘alpha = 0’ the ridge penalty.
                     alpha = 1,
                     ##
                     ## penalty.factor: Separate penalty factors can be applied to each
                     ##           coefficient. This is a number that multiplies ‘lambda’ to
                     ##           allow differential shrinkage. Can be 0 for some variables,
                     ##           which implies no shrinkage, and that variable is always
                     ##           included in the model. Default is 1 for all variables (and
                     ##           implicitly infinity for variables listed in ‘exclude’). Note:
                     ##           the penalty factors are internally rescaled to sum to nvars,
                     ##           and the lambda sequence will reflect this change.
                     penalty.factor = best_ridge_weights2,
                     type.multinomial = "grouped",
                     keep = TRUE)
## Penalty vs CV MSE plot
plot(alasso2_cv)
```

```{r predict}
y_multi_pred_class <- as.numeric(predict(alasso2, newx = new_x, type = "class", s = alasso2_cv$lambda.min))
write.csv(y_multi_pred_class, "adaptive_lasso.csv")
```
