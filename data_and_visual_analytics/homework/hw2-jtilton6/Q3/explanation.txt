a. Rating is used in both plots so the comparison is between WinsNoms and Budget.  
The WinsNoms does a better job of separation because the good rating has more variance
than the bad rating in WinsNoms, where the variance is almost equal in the Budget.  

c. Logarithmic scales are used to handle right skewness of the data, or represent 
    percentage of change
    
    Square root scale can handle left skewness
