# Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting
## Experiments show that the ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms the FC-LSTM and the state of the art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation and nowcasting.

### Why important
Precise and timely prediction of rainfall instnsity in alocal region in a relatively short tme span (0-6hrs).
Forecasting resolution and time accuracy required for nowcasting is much higher than traditional forescasting tasks like weekly average temperature prediction.


### Existing methods
#### 2 classes
- Numerical weather Prediction (NWP), requires comples and meticulous simulation of the physical equations in the atmosphere model.  
- Extrapolation type methods -  faster and more accurate.

"In essence, precipitation nowcasting is a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem
with the sequence of past radar maps as input and the sequence of a fixed number (usually larger
than 1) of future radar maps as output."

We can do a multi input multi output model approach for multiple timesteps ahead.


### Requirements for deep learning
- reasonable end-to-end model 
- sufficient data

We have sufficient data in precipitation.

### Problem
Goal is to use previously abserved radar echo sequence to forecast a fixed lenfth of the future radar maps in a local region.  From the machine learning prespective this problem can be regarded as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem.

### ConvLSTM
inputs, cell outputs, hidden states and gates are 3D tensors whose last 2 dimensions are spatial dimensions.  The ConvLSTM determines the future state of a certain cell in the grid by the inputs and past states of its local neighbors.

If we view the states as the hidden representations of moving objects a ConvLSTM with a larger transitional kernel should be able to capture faster motions while one with a smaller kernel can capture slower motions.
